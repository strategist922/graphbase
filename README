Graphbase is an implementation of the Tinkerpop Blueprints APIs on top of HBase. For the moment it's an experiment to see how the bigtable model is suitable for storing a graph. 
I'm thinking to implement some M/R algorithm on top of this infrastructure and I'm thinking to add a Scala based DSL.
More to come soon ...
